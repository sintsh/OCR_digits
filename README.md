# OCR_digits
PCA and LDA for OCR Handwritten Digits and Classification using KNN

The aim of this project is to implement Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on handwritten digits
(0-9) using the dimensional reduction techniques called Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear
Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Additionally to make a classification used k-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
algorithm.


# Methodology

Data collection:- we collected the necessary image data from Kaggle. 
PCA and LDA: used for dimension reduction 
KNN: used for hjandwritten digit classification
